# Hardware-Projects
Some Hardware controlled projects using Python and C. These little projects will mostly be Raspberry Pi and GPIO related

Some documents here will be my own written tutorials for the projects I have done, explaining software and hardware set-up, as-well as use

Other documents will be in relation to the tutorials (wiring guides, schematics etc))
